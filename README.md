# Dash Shell

`dash` is a simple Unix-style shell written in C. It supports running external commands, basic built-ins (`cd`, `exit`), and displays a colored prompt with the username and current directory.

---

## Features

* Execute external commands (e.g., `ls`, `echo`, `pwd`)
* Built-in `cd` command to change directories
* Built-in `exit` command to exit the shell
* Colored prompt:

  * Username in **blue**
  * Current directory in **green**

---

## Requirements

* GCC compiler
* Unix-like environment (Linux, WSL, macOS)
* Terminal to run the shell

---

## Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sable.git
cd Sable
```

2. Compile the source code:

```bash
gcc main.c -o dash
```

3. Run the shell:

```bash
./dash
```

---

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can:

* Run normal commands:

```bash
ls -l
pwd
echo "Hello World"
```

* Change directories:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

* Exit the shell:

```bash
exit
```

* The prompt will look like:

```text
username:/current/directory$
```

---

## Notes

* Commands like `cd` must be built-ins to affect the current shell.
* Background jobs, pipes, and input/output redirection are **not yet supported**.
* This shell is intended for learning purposes and as a foundation for building a more advanced shell.
